Zappos.com,Thu Jul 02 17:01:53 UTC 2020,"Work remotely temporarily due to COVID-19
We are a small team helping groups throughout the organization solve problems and develop new ideas. Our projects focus on the future of Zappos by building interactive experiences centered around customer service. We are a nimble team that moves fast and empowers others to build and experiment with new Zappos experiences rapidly.
We are looking for candidates who have a sense of ownership to deliver quick but extensible solutions. You will have the freedom to incubate new ideas with the backing of a large yet passionate-about-culture organization. Our current platform is built on Ruby on Rails and React.js, but we will always prioritize finding the right tool for the job.
Some of our recent projects include launching ZapposKids.com (https://www.zappos.com/e/shops/kids) and Zappos Goods for Good (https://www.zappos.com/e/goods-for-good).
What you'll be doing:
Responsibilities range from team ""ideation"" to hands-on implementation, testing, and debugging of projects at different levels of the stack as needed. Typical projects involve a responsively-designed front end, a Rails-based server application, and possibly some form of asynchronous back-end processing. You must be willing and able (and excited) to accept responsibility for enhancing required skills and completing assigned tasks over the course of changing projects and initiatives. Adapt and thrive!
What you'll bring to the table:
We are ideally looking for ""T-shaped developers""—people who have a broad interest and understanding of technology and the web, but also have deep interest in a specialized area. We want someone who fits most (or ALL!) of these bullet points:
5-7+ years production software development experience
A solid knowledge of many (not necessarily all) of these technologies: React, HTML5, CSS3, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, and relational databases.
Strong frontend development skills
Experience with modern front end JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
Experience with unit/integration testing
DevOps experience is a plus (especially with AWS and automated deployments)​.
A solid, demonstrable grasp of good web, object-oriented, and asynchronous programming concepts.
The drive and open-mind to learn and adopt new skills continually.
Side projects and ideas for side projects you haven't started yet would be great.
An open-mind and personable disposition. You like to collaborate and can give and take constructive criticism cheerfully.

Cleverbase,Mon Jun 22 09:54:06 UTC 2020,"You’re an enthusiastic Scala engineer who wants to make a difference. You’re looking for an ambitious and international team in The Hague. And we’re looking for a backend developer like you. Your contribution is going to enable The Netherlands to further digitalise and say goodbye to paper administration.
Whether you have plenty experience or no experience but plenty knowledge, you are welcome at Cleverbase. We use Domain Driven Design to tend to our business domain (Qualified Information Exchange) and develop software based on pure functional Scala (cats, cats-effect, fs2, Akka) in a microservices architecture. Because European legal standards challenge us to hone in on code quality and auditability, we are looking for a trustworthy backend developer that has an eye for aspects like these. 
Working as a backend developer at Cleverbase
As Qualified Trust Service provider, Cleverbase is licensed to issue PKI certificates within the Public Key Infrastructure of the Dutch government. With our products, you can log in, exchange information and sign documents on the highest eIDAS security level. After a one-time registration, you can, for example, digitally sign their deed of purchase with the same legal power as a signature on paper. Completely safe, with your own phone and pin code. 
During pressure cooker sessions, design sprints and in our labs, we develop prototypes to quickly discover how we can turn concepts into actual, valuable products and services. That’s how, in three days, we enabled Noria to digitally sign a European tender.
Demand for our products is high and our organisation is growing quickly. Working at Cleverbase means contributing to a safe digital environment. We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished so far and celebrate our successes together, but we’re far from done. That is why we are looking for an ambitious Scala engineer like you to come and help us. 
What we ask
Preferably an allrounder/Jack-of-all-trades, but don’t be put off by this. It’s nice if you match below profile as much as possible. Are there things you want develop, let us know how we can work on it together.

Experience with Scala and knowledge of and/or interest in Domain Driven Design, cats, cats-effect, fs2, Akka and microservices architecture.
You understand that compliance and security are extremely important for us and you have an eye for code quality, security, auditability and data integrity.
You write tests for all your code and have experience with continuous integration.
You don’t shy away from documenting when it matters.
You are available for 32-40 hours per week. 

Bonus points for 

Knowledge of and/or interest in TLS and PKI.
Experience in an ISO-27001 and/or TWS certified environment.

What we offer you

An informal and dynamic work environment in which talent, initiative and involvement are appreciated and rewarded.
Fun, ambitious and smart colleagues with enthusiasm for what they create.
Above average salary, non-contributory pension, travel and phone allowance.
26 vacation days (based on 40 hours).
Many opportunities for growth and development.
A laptop of your choice: Macbook Pro with macOS or Lenovo Thinkpad with Linux.

In this current situation we all work from home, but once we go back to working at the office, the following is included as well:

The best view of The Hague in an office building with coffee bar, food court, and fitness area, easy to reach by public transport, car or bike.
Healthy lunch served at the office every day.

Are you our new backend developer?
You’re interested and want to apply: time to update your CV, write a motivation letter via this link or call +316 1429 1425. As well when you have talents that can contribute to Cleverbase’s ambition in another way. We look forward to receiving your application!

Deep Consulting Solutions,Sat Jun 20 04:52:53 UTC 2020,"(Remote, Full-Time, Anywhere in the World)
We are looking for a skilled and passionate Full Stack Software Engineer to join our Tech Team to build and scale effective software solutions. We are in need of an enthusiastic self-starter with expertise in building highly functional solutions involving multiple systems using the Javascript (Node, Express, React stack).
What We Do
We work with niche companies in the US, Canada, the UK to restructure and automate their operation so that their businesses can grow 5-10x. We do that by effectively analyzing their business, streamlining their processes, and designing an effective automation solution that we then implement on our robust IT stack.
We make extensive use of technologies that help us accomplish results with less work — making everyone inside of our global organization more effective.
We heavily leverage:


Amazon AWS's serverless technologies and microservices for our front-end, back-end, and mobile apps (Lambda, Amplify, Cognito, S3, etc.).


Zoho's CRM and ERP Tools (Desk, Books, etc.).


Vonage/Nexmo-based telephony and communications solutions (Vonage Business Phone, Nexmo Voice/SMS, OpenTalk, etc.).


We are always looking for new technologies and welcome team members adding things to our technology stack so we can deliver more results more effectively.
What You Will Do
As an Engineer, you will be responsible for delivering the solution as per requirements put together by our Creative and Business Analysis Teams. Depending on your level, you will be responsible for either the entire project (with other engineers working in your project team) or for a part of it.
Your ultimate deliverable will be to effectively build a solution that will be implemented in the client's business and run successfully going forward.
In doing so, you will:


Design and architect complex solutions involving web apps (front+back), custom CRM/ERP's, programmable telephony, and occasionally mobile apps.


Deliver and implement your solutions.


Create effective monitoring of the solutions for effective usage and scalability.


Do anything else you deem necessary to accomplish your result.


Requirements
You are:

Responsible and driven by results.
Genuinely interested in technology.
Willing to learn, grow, and admit mistakes.
Able to communicate with other people on the project's team effectively.

You have:

A solid knowledge of Node.js, React, Express, and TypeScript.
Experience with complex SQL and NoSQL databases.
Experience with APIs to connect complex applications.
Effective written and verbal English to communicate with our international team.
Basic understanding of DevOps and SDLC to cooperate with other developers in building the product.

Will be a good plus:

Experience with Amazon AWS, serverless technologies, and microservices on its platform.
Experience with CRM and ERP systems such as Zoho and others.

What We Offer
​

Results-Focused Approach to Work

We do not look at people's activities, the number of lines of code written, etc., as the measure of success. We look strictly at the results in effectively delivered products.

Results Based Compensation Schedule

There is base pay and project bonus pay. Base pay varies significantly by the Engineer's level of ability and responsibility (Lead/Associate/Assistant) that the Engineer takes on projects - this level is reassessed after every project that the Engineer completes. Projects upon completion are rewarded with a bonus - bonus depends on the delivery of all requirements assigned to the Engineer, timeliness of delivery, rate of errors, and the amount of management attention needed in the project. Engineers who can deliver functional solutions that match requirements quickly and with little management action to correct errors get the best rewards and promotions in the organization.

Freely Arranged Schedule

You decide when you want to work. What we expect from you are results. There is a daily stand-up call — but outside of it, you can manage your schedule as you prefer.

Work as an Engineer, Not Just a Coder

Our Engineers work to build solutions and not just to write code. You will have freedom in how you want to architect the solutions you are making and we will heavily encourage initiative on your part.

Growth Within Our Organization

We are a dynamic and growing organization with a team spread around multiple continents. If you prove yourself as a responsible, driven and motivated individual, there will be opportunities for you to lead projects and manage tech teams.
Hiring Process
Our candidate selection process is designed to assess people strictly by their merit. We do not make you go through a long round of interviews, instead, we follow a straight-forward sequence:

Hop Labs,Fri Jun 19 23:21:08 UTC 2020,"The Company
At Hop Labs, our mission is simple: we build technology that meaningfully impacts people’s lives.
We work on a variety of projects in a range of industries, from fighting cancer through deep learning, to training a computer to help you find the best-fitting pair of pants. We've helped large, established companies nurture innovative ideas, and we’ve collaborated with cutting-edge startups to be the large, established companies of tomorrow.
The Team
Our team reflects our belief in quality over quantity. Some of our past projects have resulted in publications and patents, have been featured in the press, and have been deployed with well-known brands. We do few things, but we do them extremely well:


Machine Learning -- Deep Learning / AI / RNNs


Computer Vision


Product Strategy and Product Roadmap


MVP Development


We're a small team that's about making an outsized impact. We embrace diversity, investing in our employees, and flexible work schedules. We aim to enjoy our work and deliver beyond expectations. If you’re a technologist who wants to work on projects that make a difference, please reach out to us.
The Role
Currently, we’re looking to hire a full-time Software Development Engineer (ML). Titles can be arbitrary, so you should consider yourself a good fit for this if:


You enjoy solving hard technical problems at scale.


You’re comfortable proposing end-to-end technical architectures that balance modularity, scalability, operations, security, and cost.


You’re fluent in the AWS stack. This does not mean you understand every AWS service or that you have an AWS certification, but it does mean that you could independently design and build a distributed API within AWS that reflects modern best practices.


You understand that clarity and simplicity -- in code and in communication -- are worth striving for.


You have at least a passing familiarity with machine learning, and an interest in developing your skills there.


As a distributed team, some key qualities are particularly important for all of us at Hop Labs:


A strong sense of ownership and initiative


Clear and consistent communication


A collaborative mindset


Clear thinking and attention to detail for complex projects


For this role specifically:


Open to all backgrounds, though machine-learning background preferred


Intermediate to senior level preferred


Location preference: in or near Atlanta, but remote within the U.S. is possible


U.S. work authorization necessary


And if you’re not sure you’re a good fit, apply anyway! We will not think poorly of you -- some of our best folks have come from surprising backgrounds. We have made an effort to introduce a hiring process that is low-pressure and skills-focused, and compatible with the other commitments in your life.

Currencycloud,Wed Jun 10 15:04:49 UTC 2020,"Senior Scala Engineer
Ready to shape tomorrow?
This is somewhere where innovative thinking and the power of technology know no limits. We know that the success of the business depends on the people who keep it moving, which is why we are looking for exceptional talent to join our international payments revolution.
We’re bringing simplicity, transparency &amp; scale to cross-border payments - a $120 trillion market.
About the role
Our software engineers are responsible for implementing an industry-leading API that has already processed over $50 billion of cross-border transactions for over 5 million end users, and is available to our clients 24/7. But we’re not stopping there, and our engineers are at the forefront of taking us forward to meet the demands of even greater scale.
From our monolithic datacenter beginnings we’ve moved wholesale to AWS where our system runs as a set of distributed applications. We’re currently in the process of migrating those applications over to Kubernetes and Jenkins-X as we further embrace a microservices architecture.
As a Senior Software Engineer you’ll play a key role within your team; taking responsibility for your services and the technology within them, but also in helping develop your team and its relationship with your product owner and the broader business. Teams are aligned to services and you’ll have:

clear ownership of your domain
a clean modern codebase
an independent path to production
strong platform and product support
the ability to make real changes with real business value.

Our microservices architecture enables us to explore new languages and technologies in parallel with our existing system. The core of our system has been built using Ruby, leveraging backing services like RabbitMQ, Redis, and MySQL/Aurora, but we are keen to bring in engineers with more diverse backgrounds, and help us take Currencycloud to the next level of scale.
What to expect
You will be joining the Payments team at CurrencyCloud, where we are creating software to trade currencies that unlocks unique capabilities previously not available to our customers. The nature of the always moving markets requires creating highly-scalable distributed systems.
We are looking for a person who wants to build new software in Scala, and is comfortable with reading other languages – ideally Ruby as a significant part of the backend software in the company is written in Ruby. We use various technologies for handling our data, primarily: RabbitMQ, Redis and MySQL.
The Details

Day-to-day you’ll work with a variety of tools, technologies, capabilities and processes.
Distributed systems help to achieve scalability, improve availability and run our software in  cloud-native environments on Kubernetes.
Cloud-related tools and services support these applications, such as Docker, Kubernetes, - ElasticSearch, log management systems, and Datadog APM, to name but a few.
API specifications, conforming to the OpenAPI (Swagger) standard, provide a clean boundary both externally between our customers and our product, and internally between our microservices.
Programming languages, you should be comfortable with functional programming in Scala and have experience working with other programming paradigms.  There is also some Ruby, Java &amp; Elixir in our code base.  Other important stack related tools are cats/cats-effect, doobie, http4s, circe, ZIO &amp; Tagless final.
SQL, and large SQL databases, provide the persistence layer for our applications. You’ll be working with (and know the limitations of using) such large datastores.
Infrastructure automation is primarily owned by the infrastructure team, but you will be a consumer of their work, familiarity with AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes (K8s) and Docker is beneficial.
Testing approaches, including TDD, BDD and Contract Testing, all form an important part of our approach to quality assurance; ensuring that the code that we write forms products that are fit for use. Our QA engineers use Cucumber.
Agile development, with teams broadly aligned with the Spotify - Squads &amp; Tribes - model, helps us deliver incremental improvements to our products in an iterative manner. Advocating this model, and joining us on a journey of continuous improvement, is a key attribute of senior members of our teams.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines allow us to “automate all the things”, providing repeatable builds and consistent deployments.
GitHub, and the GitHub PR review process, forms a core part of our developer workflow, and peer reviews help share knowledge and improve quality.
Teamwork, and cross-team collaboration, is fundamental to the delivery of our applications. Whilst each application has an independent path to production, there will always be some activities and initiatives that span multiple teams and require cross-team collaboration. Within your team you’ll need to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, including Product Owners and QA, as part of your product development.

None of these on their own are a must-have to apply for the role, but it would be useful to share with us any knowledge or experience that you have in these areas.
I’m intrigued…what’s the interview process?

Quick chat with our internal tech recruiter (to make sure things like salary, location, general approaches to dev are aligned to how we work.)
Tech chat over a hangout with a Tech Lead or Senior Engineer (we want to have open discussions with you about how you approach coding and what you like from a team that you work with)
Normally we’d invite you to the office, but in Covid-19 times it will be all over video! We’ll talk about your experience, some coding approaches and you’ll also get a chance to talk with one of our - - Product Managers about how we all work together
Chat with our engineering manager
We’ll make you an offer
We’re colleagues!

Anything extra to add?
A comfortable no dress code policy &amp; flexible work from home arrangements are provided for all our employees.
We offer a comprehensive range of employee benefits which include 25 days paid leave, 5% pension, BUPA health insurance, life insurance, long term sickness protection, a day off for your birthday and socials every Friday.
So, if you’re ready to join a thriving global business in the heart of London, get in touch for an informal discussion!

Pinguin AG	,Wed Jun 10 12:37:37 UTC 2020,"What is key to every business success? It is keeping focus on what you are best at and leave your competitors behind. Many freelancers and small business owners are forced to do everything themselves resulting in loss of focus and missed business opportunities. They can’t use their time efficiently because they get distracted by incoming calls, messages and mails or miss on opportunities because they were not able to answer that one call that would have been the next big deal.
Our powerful and constantly developing software as a service communication platform is for more than 20 years a catalyst for success in that our customers never miss an opportunity while being able to maintain focus and concentrate on their core activities.
Your Challenges:
We are a small company working in small teams and consider ourselves as “startup at heart”. As our company group is successfull in business since 20 years, but we’ve kept our flat hierarchies and let’s-do-it-mentality. We believe that a pleasant atmosphere helps teams to be effective and creative. Creating, maintaining and fostering exactly that will be your first challenge. We would love to hear your ideas about how you’d like to coach and guide your team. You will be their go-to-person when it comes to providing reasonable architectural decision making and solid plans that cover the details as well as the bigger picture.
Tech-wise, our solution is build in Java using Spring and Hibernate. Imagine it as a big variety of micro-services using RESTful APIs which empower HTML5-Web-Applications. To be completely honest, there is still some legacy code involved that we want to get rid of.
How will you bring its functionalities into new services, allowing new features to be created quickly? To save our customers time, you will need to ensure connections to a fistful of cloud services like Google, Office365, Apple, CRM-systems, telephony services and many more.
Creating a new backend infrastructure with a modern Frontend application is your challenge number two. Right now, we are combining the concepts of Micro-Services in the backend with Web-Components and HTML5 in the Frontend. You’ve got better ideas? Let us know - you’re the expert!
Your responsibilities:

Lead and mentor a fistful of mighty Backend Engineers.
Foster a vivid and powerful learning culture among our Engineers.
Coach and develop hard and soft skills of your teammates.
Be responsible for the entire software lifecycle from A to Z. You build it, you own it you run it.
Bring existing applications to the next decade.
Create a strategy to turn a software platform into a web service.
Collaborate with our Frontend Engineers to connect a new UI.
Build new APIs, scalable micro-services for HTML5 and mobile services in addition to new features.

Things you’ve ideally experienced already:

Knowing how to create and maintain a good team spirit.
Bringing people and their ideas to the next level.
Coaching Engineers to improve their coding skills.
Establishing good collaboration with Product Owners and other stakeholders.
Ideally, seen a university from the inside. You haven’t? No worries, we like autodidacts too!
5-10 years of expertise with Java, Spring, Hibernate.
Crafting RESTful APIs, micro-services, SQL databases.
Working with RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch and GWT are an asset.
Fostering a DevOps-mindset.
Creating CI/CD using Jenkins, Stash,Git and Linux
Developing prototypes and providing incremental improvements.
Getting sparkles in your eyes about backend infrastructure architecture.
Not afraid of Frontend using HTML5 either.

It’s a match, if we share some core beliefs:

Treat your teammates as you’d like to be treated.
Be a good mentor and coach to your team.
People before technology &amp; Smart solutions over ideology..
Clear and transparent communication and expectations.
Being a team player and not a lonesome hero.
Contributing your favourite idea to a discussion with colleagues is about creating something bigger, not about telling others how great you are or how things should be done.
Agile Methods like Scrum or Kanban are a tool to improve the product step by step and flexible, not a religion.
As a techlead it’s not your mission to be right. It’s your mission to support your team developing the optimal solution while ensuring it fits into the overall concept.
No discussion, no honey. We are no place for know-it-alls and Hierarchy-people.

Your perks:

Choose what's best for you: MacBook or PC?
Ride a bike or a train: we provide a bike or public transport ticket
Stay healthy and relaxed: we support Urban Sports Club
Become a Foam master or Bartender: enjoy the best coffee machine and beer from tap in our office
Level up your skills: we will get you eye-opening books
Take a course: we will support your hunger for education
You need some holidays? 28 days for everyone
You don´t smoke? Get one extra day off
You have hobbies and a family? Great. We have core ours to maintain flexibility
Sounds terrifying? Bummer! We’re sorry to hear that.

Sounds terrific? Great! Get in touch.

Senior full stack Developer (.Net)
32-36 uur – Zeist
Voor werkgevers en deelnemers zijn solide en toegankelijke pensioenportalen bijna een vanzelfsprekendheid. Achter de schermen gebeurt er van alles om het aan de voorkant zo effectief mogelijk te laten werken. Van a tot z ben jij verantwoordelijk voor softwareontwikkeling én begeleid je daarbij als senior de minder ervaren collega’s.
Jouw baan als senior full stack developer
Pensioen, iets voor later? Zeker niet. Jij begrijpt als senior full stack developer dat er veel mensen zijn die graag overzicht en duidelijkheid willen over hun pensioensituatie. Met de brede IT-kennis die je meebrengt, weet je wat er nodig is om dat te bereiken. Vanuit een DevOps-team werk je aan front-end- en back-end-oplossingen en ben je zowel verantwoordelijk voor de realisatie als het live gaan én houden.
Miljoenen mensen maken gebruik van de verschillende pensioenportalen, waar voor jou de nodige technische complexiteiten in zitten. Het Agile-werken zit in ons bloed, waarbij je met je scrumteam alle eindgebruikers op hun wenken bedient. Waar jij mee te maken krijgt? We streven naar werkwijzen als ‘fail fast – fail often’, testautomatisering, TDD en ATDD/BDD. Uiteraard is een goede beveiliging van al deze online portalen van cruciaal belang, dus ook daar komt jouw expertise op dit vlak goed van pas. De eerste stappen zijn al gezet: aan jou het vervolg.
Jij laat je gelden bij het:

ontwikkelen en beheren van pensioenportalen voor werkgevers en pensioendeelnemers.
naar een hoger niveau brengen van DevOps.
afstemmen met (back-end-)teams binnen PGGM.

Je werkt in het scrumteam binnen het cluster Online Services en Werkgevers. Het team bestaat uit een product owner, scrum master, tester, 2 businessanalisten en 5 ontwikkelaars. Van die ontwikkelaars is een groot deel full stack developer. Er wordt gezamenlijk toegewerkt naar de DevOps-transitie: als senior heb jij vanuit het team hierin een sturende rol. De collega’s zijn ambitieus, vol humor en halen het beste uit de technische mogelijkheden in een sector die ertoe doet.
Teamlid en toekomstig collega Gino Bos vertelt je alvast over zijn ervaringen. Ook kun je de video over Software Development binnen PGGM bekijken, ook met onze collega Gino.
Jouw profiel als data en proces consultant
In het spanningsveld waar jij actief bent, ben je in staat om verschillende belangen samen te brengen en te begeleiden naar een gemeenschappelijk resultaat. Jij verkrijgt inzichten en werkt toe naar significante resultaten wat betreft procesverbetering en houdt daarbij rekening met verschillende aandachtsgebieden. Hierin is het belangrijk om snel te schakelen in de rol van adviseur, begeleider en coach voor het team. Je behoudt het overzicht en blijft gedurende het traject scherp op de materie om het beste resultaat te behalen.
Jij hebt:

een wo-diploma, bijvoorbeeld in de richting Bedrijfskunde of Economie.
minimaal 3 á 5 jaar ervaring in een rol als adviseur of consultant in data-gerelateerde opdrachten.
aantoonbare ervaring met Lean-, Six Sigma-, Agile-principes en methoden. Bij voorkeur ben je hierin gecertificeerd en heb je een Black of Green Belt.
ervaring met procesbegeleiding en stakeholdermanagement.

een ruim opleidingsbudget voor interne en externe trainingen of opleidingen.

Podomaatic,Mon Nov 19 04:59:26 UTC 2018,"RFP: JavaScript component for embedding a list of Podcast Episodes
in Website Builders with specific functionality for Wordpress
The goal of this project is to repurpose our JavaScript components currently available
for Weebly, to allow users on the Wordpress platform to embed their podcast episodes
and information on their own custom webpages.
Recent episode player:
This will always display the latest episode published by a user. It includes playback,
timeline bar, description, title and mute buttons.
Podcast Info:
Basic information about the user’s podcast including Category, Genre, Location,
Followers.
Episode Grid:
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a grid format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as transparency vs white bar background for episode titles
(See mockups below)
Episode List
This plugin allows the user to display the entire list of episodes in a List format.
Playback functionality is similar to the Recent episode player. There are some basic
customizable options such as displaying the episode thumbnail image or not. (See
mockups below)
All components must adapt their font style (Title, body, caption) and color to the
webpage theme the user has. All components must offer a color player and a gray
player version, background opacity color, and must be responsive to mobile and
desktop)
Examples of the current plugins in Weebly:
http://www.minimalist-theme.podomatic.net/
http://www.performer-theme.podomatic.net/
http://www.writer-theme.podomatic.net/
http://www.complete-theme.podomatic.net/
Requirements for the embeddable component:
The component should be pure JavaScript, i.e. not an embeddable iframe, and
be enabled either via data attributes or a JavaScript call. i..e the html might look
something like:

The component should make use of Podomatic’s API which uses JSON over REST. A
sample response looks like this:
https://api.podomatic.com/v2/podcasts/5133407/episodes?podcast=true
The following attributes should be customizable:
● The style (grid or list)
● Number of items per page
●
The color scheme (currently light or dark)
●
Whether background images are displayed or not
The component will be styled mostly by the choice of style and color scheme
however it should be possible to override the styles from a global style sheet.
Additionally the layout should be responsive.
The component should load new pages using an infinite scrolling mechanism.
Requirements for the Wordpress plugin integration:
As part of our strategy we also want the above component to be made available
as a Wordpress plugin. To keep the look and feel of the application consistent
this should use the JavaScript file created above. It should also provide the
same level of customizability.
Additional notes
All resulting code and assets will belong to Podomatic. The embeddable code
will be hosted on our own CDN and the Wordpress Plugin on their infrastructure.
Please provide specific instructions on how you would go about building and what in your experience would be useful or relevant to the project.  Also include either a resume or gitbub. Thank you,

Breng jij bij het CBS AI tot leven?
Over het CBS
In een samenleving waarin informatie explosief toeneemt, is het vrij kunnen beschikken over betrouwbare en integrale data cruciaal. Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.
Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.
Wat ga je doen?
Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.
Je gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).
Voor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier
Wie zoeken wij
Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pré is. Vanzelfsprekend kun je user stories opstellen en gemaakte software systematisch testen. Je bent analytisch, creatief, denkt in oplossingen, leert snel, bent een pionier en kan ingewikkelde materie op aansprekende wijze uitleggen aan collega’s die minder van techniek weten. Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.
Waar kom je te werken
Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, één van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot één van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren. De sfeer van dit team is die van een Start-up, met hoge ambities, grote uitdagingen en de gedrevenheid om de Information Dialogue tot een succes te maken.

Atlantic Media Values:
Across Atlantic Media, generally, the firm looks for two “pillar gifts” in you, and everyone else.  In all of us, these are more aspirational than actual, but they are central in our intentions –


Force of Ideas: At the center of Atlantic Media work are the ideas within our writing. We believe that ideas – to the good and not – have consequence. Our highest work is bringing rigor, insight, intellectual integrity, to that ultimate purpose of separating the bad from the good, and giving voice to the latter.

Spirit of Generosity: Atlantic Media seeks in its ranks those with natural disposition toward service and selfless conduct. Atlantic Media writing should be cut from the same cloth – critical on the merits, but informed by charity and forbearance in measuring motive and personal character.

Atlantic Media is an EOE of Minorities/Women/Vets/Disability.
Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

iPhone Photography School,Wed Nov 14 13:55:40 UTC 2018,"Attention Senior Backend Developers:
“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”
You’ve finally found it…
The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.
If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!
But only if you keep reading.
iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.
On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.
Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.
To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.
8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School
1 - Solve Interesting Problems
Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.
This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.
We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.
The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.
2 - Work With A Clean Codebase
Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”
We don’t work like that.
We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.
This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.
3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow
You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.
We get how important growth is for developers.
Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.
Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.
4 - Get Expert Guidance
Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.
If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.
Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.
Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.
5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time
Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?
You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.
We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.
This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.
6 - Work From Anywhere In The World
We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!
If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.
7 - Stability You Can Count On
Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.
Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.
You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.
8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code
Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.
During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.
Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.
Here’s What We Expect From You…

You’re excellent at PHP
You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP
You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years
You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems
You want to participate in scrum teamwork
You have an excellent attention to detail

moovel Group GmbH,Tue Nov 06 15:16:58 UTC 2018,"Routing Squad seeks Backend Engineer (f/m)
Hi,
we are Sudip, Ali, Paul and Aram from the routing squad. Our job is to create and enable routing solutions for our products and customers. We are looking for a backend-focused engineer to join our great squad. The main programming languages we use are Java 8 and Javascript ES6, but we believe that continuous learning is essential in an ever-changing and fast-paced technological environment.
FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US
Our vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 280 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.
HOW THE ROLE WORKS
We gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. With us you will use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO
Teams at moovel choose the tools they regard as the best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it).

• You implement routing algorithms in Java
• You design and provide APIs around our routing services
• You are involved in building infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our routing engine
• You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions
• You collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features
ABOUT YOU
You should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging Java code and should be concerned about clean, high quality and maintainable code. Graph theory and routing algorithms are well known to you. Also, vehicle routing problems (VRP) are no strangers to you or at least something you always wanted to learn more about and master. You have experience with and are open to get deep into OSM and GTFS data formats. Some exposure to service based architectures would be useful. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud computing. As it is our corporate language, you should have good writing and verbal communication skills in English.
BENEFITS
• Choose your own hardware
• Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices

Hi,
we’re the transit team at moovel. We build services, munch data and process real-time information in all things transit - and we’re looking for a backend engineer in the Berlin office to
join us in our effort to provide great public transit APIs as one of the pillars for moovel’s rapidly expanding mobility platform.

ABOUT YOU
You should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.
You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies.

Datawrapper,Tue Oct 30 13:58:53 UTC 2018,"We are Datawrapper - a web-based charting tool, and we want you to join us as a client-facing software engineer in our office in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg.
What's this exciting new position about? Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.
The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:


Developing new visualization features for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.

Building &amp; maintaining integrations with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.

Extending Datawrapper to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don’t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.

Who we’re looking for:

We’re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, preferrably full-time, but open to flexible work time arrangements.
You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will not be possible to do this job entirely remote. Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.

On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and Svelte. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.
We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. We’re happy to show you how our stack works.


What the ""client-facing"" part entails:

A significant part of the job will involve interacting with users and customers. be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent
That means we're looking for someone with good communication, interpersonal and written skills.

Strong English skills will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.
Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.
If you have any prior work you can show us, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don’t, please don’t feel discouraged to apply.

What we can offer:


A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, where seven of us work (Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans &amp; David). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.


Flexible working hours. We're looking for someone who wants to work for us at least four days a week. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.


A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere. We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.


We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills &amp; experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:

Stride Consulting,Wed Oct 24 19:14:53 UTC 2018,"Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.
Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.
We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.
As a Strider, you’ll find a learning opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:

Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.
Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.
Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.
Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.

A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer
You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.
You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:
9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.
10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.
10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.
12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride
12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.
1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.
1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.
2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.
6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.
What you’ll be doing

Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.
Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.
Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.
Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).
Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.

You’re a fit for Stride if you have:

3+ years of software development experience
Experience in multiple programming languages
Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks
Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming

What you can expect from us:

Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about
Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)
Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace
No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC
$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development

Squirro,Tue Oct 23 09:36:02 UTC 2018,"We’re looking for senior engineers with solid Python skills to join our team, which is building a platform, called Squirro, for unstructured data analysis.
Squirro can ingest data from anywhere, be it public on the web or social medium or internal, such as a CRM, database or ITSM system, and add structure to it so that it can be delivered to business users using our dashboard visualisations or consumed by other systems using our APIs. We add structure to unstructured data by employing a range of techniques, from statistical and Bayesian models to supervised and unsupervised machine learning which we serve to our customers as a unified and patented technology we call Smartfilters. Meanwhile, for our users, we provide a simple interface to access these technologies so that anyone with basic analytical skills can get value out of their companies unstructured data.
Our customers are some of the largest banks and financial institutions in the world, across the US, UK, EU, Switzerland and Asia. Many of our customers are just beginning to discover the potential of unstructured data analysis and we’re excited by the opportunity as an early mover in this young market. While we host some of these customers in the cloud, the majority prefer to install Squirro on-premise for security reasons.
We need you to help us build out and scale this platform, as our customers apply it to ever growing volumes of data and discover new ways to structure and analyse that data.
Required Qualifications

Exceptional programming experience in Python
Extensive knowledge of UNIX/Linux from a developers perspective
Strong track record in software systems design, from initial implementation to performance optimisation and scaling
Experience developing professionally as part of a team, giving and receiving code reviews, test-driven development etc.
Good communication skills with fluency in English
Swiss citizenship or work permit in Switzerland, or living and working in UK, EU or EFTA member state. We’d love to hire people worldwide but Swiss immigration law makes this problematic except in rare cases.

Nice to Have

Experience with information retrieval technologies (Elasticsearch, Lucene)
Comfortable working with large datasets and designing systems able to process and scale up to large data volumes
Familiarity with RESTful web services and microservices architectures
Experience with MySQL, Redis, nginx, Zookeeper and other technologies in the Squirro stack
Familiarity with AWS, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible and other DevOps related tools
Awareness of machine learning as applied to text analysis

Working with Us
Squirro is a Swiss startup with an international flavour. Our team of passionate technology geeks and entrepreneurs mix local “Swissness” with American, German, French, Russian, Indian, Portuguese, Polish and British into an all-round startup team that combines the excellence of the ETH and EPFL with experience from technology companies such as Microsoft and Google as well as Swiss players such as local.ch and DeinDeal.
We love Python and ElasticSearch on the server side and JavaScript, backbone.js, React, D3 and more on the client side. We work with git, believe in testing, code reviews, continuous integration and continuous deployment. Our work is structured loosely around scrum with help from Jira and the Atlassian tool suite. We take design and user experience seriously and apply machine learning in the context of text analysis.
Most of all we’re serious about building a world-class company and our compensation package includes shares because we believe our employees should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication.

Constructive,Mon Oct 22 15:56:13 UTC 2018,"Constructive (https://constructive.co), a leading brand experience design &amp; digital design agency that works exclusively with social impact organizations is looking for an outstanding technical expert and creative thinker to take over for our current Technology Team Lead, who will sadly be transitioning out of the role at the end of 2018 to live abroad.
If you’re an experienced technologist who wants to work on websites and products that are at the front of the field, knows how to architect and build complex websites, thrives on being a consultative, collaborative problem solver, and believes that the best digital experiences happen when strategy, technology, and design work together, then we’d love to hear from you. If you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want the work you do to make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.
##A bit about the role
Our Technology Team Lead needs a holistic understanding of modern web development techniques and infrastructure. They need experience building strong and scalable websites. They must thrive on being hands-on with development projects. They’ll need a leadership mindset, and must be capable of working on multi-disciplinary teams to communicate complex technological choices to non-developers.
That’s all fancy job-posting language for: you really know your stuff and don’t have a big ego, you take responsibility for the quality of our work and the growth of your team, you still like to get your hands dirty with code, and you’re an effective collaborator—especially with people who don’t understand technology as well as you do.
##A bit about us
We’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We’ve got high expectations and we’ve got the work ethic to match them. We’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.
##A bit about diversity
We believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients. So, in considering if Constructive is a good fit for you, know that all we care about is that you’re qualified to do the job, share most or all of our values, and want to be here. These are the things we’ll be evaluating for every applicant—and if you meet those and add to our diversity, all the better.
##What we need you to do extremely well
This role combines technology team leadership and hands-on development, emphasizing one or the other at any given time. We’ll need you to have strong demonstrated success having done all or most of these things for at least 3-5 years—and a passion for doing them well.


Provide strong technical leadership—both for our internal team of developers, strategists, and designers; and for our clients and occasional external dev partners.
Manage and mentor junior developers—two in-house developers, one ongoing external partner, and any additional developers when project load requires it.

Guide development team and our company on planning, prioritizing, mitigating risks, and balancing technical debt to meet project milestones so that we deliver exceptional work that meets expectations.

Work with stakeholders to define strategic goals and the context in which they need to be met, gather requirements, and produce technical documentation that makes it very clear how technology will help achieve them.

Develop requirements, specifications, and architecture to document what we’re building and what’s been built.

Lead development of ambitious digital products, serving as the point person for both the end-to-end process and the outcomes we deliver, aligning our work with Constructive’s broader strategic position as a leading brand experience design firm.

Be a hands-on developer who takes on specific aspects of complex jobs or plays a lead developer role on a project when needed.

Review code and provide feedback on work done by other developers; oversee the UAT and QA processes in coordination with project managers.

Improve best practices, recommend tools, and build frameworks that make our work more efficient, effective, and technically front-of field.

Be the face of Constructive’s technical expertise throughout client engagements, in the development community, and when needed in our sales cycle.

Contribute to developing proposals and estimates for technical projects, particularly those with complex requirements.

Lead vetting and hiring of web developers and external development partners.

Be a team player who knows how to lead, has a bias towards listening, takes serious pride in their work, and is always looking for our process and results to be better the next time out.
It definitely helps if you also have a good sense of humor

##Expertise that’s important in our work
Right now, these are the specific technologies and tasks that are essential to our work. We’ll need you to have about 5 years of experience in most of these things, and we’re very open to new ideas on which specific technologies and tools can improve on what we have.

Expert Wordpress &amp; Drupal development (Minimum 5 years of experience)
Expert front-end development experience
Strong experience with Webpack / Gulp / SCSS
Strong experience doing large-scale content migrations
Strong experience doing third-party integrations (Solr, Salesforce, Mailchimp, Fluxx)
Experience with Data Visualization (D3, Highcharts)
Experience with Infrastructure, System Administration &amp; DevOps
Experience with ES6, Node, React

##What’s in it for you?
Work/Life balance matters at Constructive, and we do our best to make sure everyone is well-taken care of with a great mix of salary, benefits and perks, opportunities for professional growth, and a healthy dose of time off. We also always reward individual initiative and outsized contributions to our collective success. Added to your base salary, here’s what we have on tap for 2018-2019 to add:
