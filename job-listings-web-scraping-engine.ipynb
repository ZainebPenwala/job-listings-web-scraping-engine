To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.\\nOn the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.\\nRight now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.\\nTo attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.\\n8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School\\n1 - Solve Interesting Problems\\nMost of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.\\nThis includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.\\nWe have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.\\nThe point is, you’ll never be bored working here.\\n2 - Work With A Clean Codebase\\nTell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”\\nWe don’t work like that.\\nWe spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.\\nThis long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.\\n3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow\\nYou love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.\\nWe get how important growth is for developers.\\nWant to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.\\nWant to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.\\n4 - Get Expert Guidance\\nOur developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.\\nIf there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.\\nBesides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.\\nJoin our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.\\n5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time\\nHave you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?\\nYou abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.\\nWe do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.\\nThis means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.\\n6 - Work From Anywhere In The World\\nWe understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!\\nIf the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.\\n7 - Stability You Can Count On\\nMost startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.\\nRather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.\\nYou don't have to worry about the company running out of money.\\n8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code\\nHelping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.\\nDuring the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.\\nYour work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.\\nHere’s What We Expect From You…\\n\\nYou’re excellent at PHP\\nYou’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP\\nYou've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years\\nYou have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems\\nYou want to participate in scrum teamwork\\nYou have an excellent attention to detail\\n\\nPlease only apply if you meet all these criteria.

We build services, munch data and process real-time information in all things transit - and we’re looking for a backend engineer in the Berlin office to\\njoin us in our effort to provide great public transit APIs as one of the pillars for moovel’s rapidly expanding mobility platform.\\nFIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 250 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.\\nHOW THE ROLE WORKS\\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.\\nWith us you’ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools\\nof their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.\\nSOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it). On the Frontend (IOS, Android and Web) we adopted and embraced Technologies like Swift, Kotlin, Rx or React.\\nBreaking down concrete tasks for this position is not that easy, but that's what makes it so exciting. Here are some things we want to entrust you right away:\\n\\nYou write, monitor, scale and architect microservices that comprise our transit backend\\nYou build infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our data stores\\nYou develop services using Node.js &amp; Python\\nYou perform analysis to enable data driven decisions\\nYou write processing pipelines in Python\\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features\\n\\nABOUT YOU\\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.\\nYou should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies. \\nAs it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.\\nBENEFITS\\n\\nChoose your own hardware\\nWorking with newest technologies &amp; microservices\\nCompany pension plan\\nFree breakfast, coffee &amp; water\\nMobility allowance\\nBe part of an interdisciplinary team of experts\\nWorking on products with a high impact on society\\nInternational teams\\nChild care allowance\\nFlexible working hours\\n\\nSounds good?\\nWe are more than happy to meet you soon!

Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June.

This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy.
